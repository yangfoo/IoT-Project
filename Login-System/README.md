# üîê  Login & Register System

This is a developable login and register system. Enter your username and password to register or login to account. Automatically stores the entered account in its memory. When you want to login again, you can enter without any problems. If you try to login when you don't have an account, it will give you an error message. If you already have an account, it will give a successfully login message and than we can design it as we like for the rest of the program.
